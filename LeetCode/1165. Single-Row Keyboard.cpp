/*
There is a special keyboard with all keys in a single row.

Given a string keyboard of length 26 indicating the layout of the keyboard (indexed from 0 to 25), initially your finger is at index 0. To type a character, you have to move your finger to the index of the desired character. The time taken to move your finger from index i to index j is |i - j|.

You want to type a string word. Write a function to calculate how much time it takes to type it with one finger.

 

Example 1:

Input: keyboard = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", word = "cba"
Output: 4
Explanation: The index moves from 0 to 2 to write 'c' then to 1 to write 'b' then to 0 again to write 'a'.
Total time = 2 + 1 + 1 = 4. 
Example 2:

Input: keyboard = "pqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmno", word = "leetcode"
Output: 73

class Solution {
public:
    //use map
    int calculateTime(string keyboard, string word) {
        
        unordered_map<int,int> lmap;
        
        
        for(int i=0; i<keyboard.size(); i++) {
            lmap[keyboard[i]-'a'] = i;
        }
        
        int prev =0;
        int result=0;
        
        for(int i=0; i<word.size(); i++){
            result = result + abs(prev - lmap[word[i]-'a']);
            prev = lmap[word[i]-'a'];
        }
        
        return result;
        
        
    }
};
