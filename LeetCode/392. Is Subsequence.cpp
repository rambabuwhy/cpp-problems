/*
Given a string s and a string t, check if s is subsequence of t.

A subsequence of a string is a new string which is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

Follow up:
If there are lots of incoming S, say S1, S2, ... , Sk where k >= 1B, and you want to check one by one to see if T has its subsequence. In this scenario, how would you change your code?

bool isSubsequence(string s, string t) {

        int rl = 0,  rr = t.size();

            if(s[ll]==t[rl]) ll++;
            rl++;
