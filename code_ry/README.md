<h1>The Art of Problem Solving with C++: A Step-by-Step Guide <br>
by Rambabu Yerajana</h1>


There are several patterns or techniques that you can use to approach and solve many types of problems. Here are some commonly used patterns:



[1] Brute Force: Start with a simple and naive solution, and try all possible combinations to solve the problem. This is usually the first step to understand the problem and constraints.



[2] Greedy: Choose the locally optimal solution at each step to reach the global optimum. This approach is useful when the problem has a property of "optimal substructure".



[3] Divide and Conquer: Break the problem into smaller sub-problems that are easier to solve, solve them recursively, and combine the solutions to the original problem.



[4] Dynamic Programming: Solve sub-problems only once and store their solutions to reuse them in future calculations. This approach is useful when the problem has a property of "overlapping sub-problems".



[5] Backtracking: Explore all possible solutions by incrementally building candidates to the solutions, and backtrack whenever the candidate solutions are no longer feasible.



[6] Depth-First Search: Explore all possible solutions by recursively visiting every node in a tree/graph.



[7] Breadth-First Search: Explore all possible solutions by visiting all nodes at a given level before moving on to the next level.



[8] Two-Pointers: Maintain two pointers that traverse the array or data structure simultaneously, usually from both ends, to find a solution in linear time.



[9] Sliding Window: Maintain a window of elements in the array or data structure, and slide it over to find the desired solution in linear time.



[10] Binary Search: Divide the array or data structure in half at each step to find a solution in logarithmic time.
