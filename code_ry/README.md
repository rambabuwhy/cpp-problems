 
There are several patterns or techniques that you can use to approach and solve many types of problems. Here are some commonly used patterns:

Brute Force: Start with a simple and naive solution, and try all possible combinations to solve the problem. This is usually the first step to understand the problem and constraints.

Greedy: Choose the locally optimal solution at each step to reach the global optimum. This approach is useful when the problem has a property of "optimal substructure".

Divide and Conquer: Break the problem into smaller sub-problems that are easier to solve, solve them recursively, and combine the solutions to the original problem.

Dynamic Programming: Solve sub-problems only once and store their solutions to reuse them in future calculations. This approach is useful when the problem has a property of "overlapping sub-problems".

Backtracking: Explore all possible solutions by incrementally building candidates to the solutions, and backtrack whenever the candidate solutions are no longer feasible.

Depth-First Search: Explore all possible solutions by recursively visiting every node in a tree/graph.

Breadth-First Search: Explore all possible solutions by visiting all nodes at a given level before moving on to the next level.

Two-Pointers: Maintain two pointers that traverse the array or data structure simultaneously, usually from both ends, to find a solution in linear time.

Sliding Window: Maintain a window of elements in the array or data structure, and slide it over to find the desired solution in linear time.

Binary Search: Divide the array or data structure in half at each step to find a solution in logarithmic time.
